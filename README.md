Write a brief description of your project in the README.md file:

In this project we were assigned to create 3 categories[Men, Women, Kids] that is basic template of a clothing website using HTML, CSS, JS.

Here we are fetching the data using free api link, where we are fetching all the data that is image , price , categories , brand, title etc.

for fetching we are using the fetch function and giving the link of the free api.

I have used 3 functions renderList, renderCard and opentab where we are using renderlist to loop through the different category.

renderCard is used fetch the data from the api such as image, price etc dynamically by creating the custom classes.

opentab function is used to create the navigation between the pages.

for creating the styles i have used Cascading style sheet. for displaying on webpage i have used the Hyper text markup language.
